# Ablate: A fork of Bloat

Ablate (n): To remove or destroy, esp. by cutting, abrading or evaporating.

Ablate is derived from Bloat, a very minimal "Web 1.5" client. It uses Frames. 

The goals of Ablate are

* Bring the interface to HTML5 standards (no framesets) 
* Use Minimal amounts of Javascript (avoiding anything not vanilla JS)
* Create a minimal UI that isn't eye-searing

You can find the upstream if you look hard enough. I have chosen to not link it here due to Reasons:tm:. I'm not a fan of its developer but wanted to hack on a half not shite client. 



# Requirements:

- Go 1.20


# Building and Installation:

Typing make will build the binary 
```
make
```

Edit the default config file. See the bloat.conf file for more details.
```
vim bloat.conf
```

Run the binary

```
./bloat
```

You can now access the frontend at http://127.0.0.1:8080, which is the default
listen address. See the INSTALL file for more details.
